                <div id="t-elem3" class="celem">The main cause of wars is the desire of political forces to use armed struggle to achieve various goals. </div>

                <div id="t-elem6" class="celem">Psychologists such as E. Durban and John Bowlby have argued that aggression is inherent in human nature. It is fueled by sublimation and projection, when a person turns his discontent into prejudice and hatred towards other races, religions,
                    nations or ideologies. According to this theory, the state creates and maintains a certain order in local society and at the same time creates the basis for aggression in the form of war.</div>

                <div id="t-elem8" class="celem">Scientists who study evolutionary psychology tend to argue that human wars are analogous to the behavior of animals fighting over territory or competing for food or a mate. Animals are aggressive by nature, and in the human environment
                    such aggressiveness translates into wars. However, with the development of technology, human aggression has reached such a limit that it begins to threaten the survival of the entire species.

                <div id="t-elem10" class="celem">Sigmund Freud regarded aggression as one of the basic instincts determining the psychological "springs," the orientation and meaning of human existence, and based on this position.</div>
