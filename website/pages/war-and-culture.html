                <div id="t-elem3" class="celem">War is the most destructive activity known to humanity. Its purpose is to use violence to compel opponents to submit and surrender.In order to understand it, artists have, throughout history, blended colors, textures and patterns to depict
                    wartime ideologies, practices, values and symbols. Their work investigates not only artistic responses to war, but the meaning of violence itself.</div>
                <div id="t-elem4" class="celem">Some philosophers saw in war a higher meaning. So, Hegel saw the high value of war in the fact that it saves the moral health of peoples, the war "protects the nations from decay. I. A. Ilyin underscored the "spiritual meaning" of war,
                    he wrote that "the free, in-depth search for truth, goodness and beauty should not cease among the people involved in the war, but should flare up even brighter. </div>
                <div id="t-elem5" class="celem">Nietzsche wrote that "war and courage have done more great things than love for one's neighbor. For Prudhon, war is "a divine phenomenon, just, virtuous, moral, holy, a special kind of religious revelation.</div>
