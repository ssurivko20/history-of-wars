                <div id="t-elem4" class="celem">In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter part of the 20th century, in the aftermath of two World Wars and in the shadow of nuclear, biological, and chemical holocaust, more was written on the subject than
                    ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of war, to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention, are of great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and determines human behaviour.</div>
                <div id="t-elem5" class="celem">Military strategy is a set of ideas implemented by military organizations to pursue desired strategic goals. Derived from the Greek word strategos, the term strategy, when it appeared in use during the 18th century, was seen in its narrow
                    sense as the "art of the general", or "'the art of arrangement" of troops. Military strategy deals with the planning and conduct of campaigns, the movement and disposition of forces, and the deception of the enemy.</div>

                <div id="t-elem7" class="celem">The role of personality in history of wars</div>
                <div id="t-elem8" class="celem">Sun Tzu is often considered as the father of Eastern military strategy and greatly influenced Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese historical and modern war tactics. The Art of War by Sun Tzu grew in popularity and saw practical use
                    in Western society as well. Strategy differs from tactics, in that strategy refers to the employment of all of a nation's military capabilities through high level and long term planning, development, and procurement to guarantee security
                    or victory. Tactics is the art of organizing forces on or near the battlefield to secure objectives as part of the broader military strategy.</div>
                <div id="t-elem9" class="celem">The Greatest leaders such as Napoleon, Alexander Macedonian, Genghis Khan and King Leonidas have used unique and genius Military strategys to achieve victory and some of them were even close to taking over the world! </div>
                <div id="t-elem10" class="celem">The Trojan War</div>
                <div id="t-elem11" class="celem">The Trojan War was fought between Greeks and the defenders of the city of Troy in Anatolia sometime in the late Bronze Age. The story has grabbed the imagination for millennia but a conflict between Mycenaeans and Hittites may well have
                    occurred, even if its representation in epic literature such as Homer's Iliad is almost certainly more myth than reality.</div>
                <div id="t-elem12" class="celem">The Trojan War has defined and shaped the way ancient Greek culture has been viewed right up to the 21st century CE. The story of gods and heroic warriors is perhaps one of the richest single surviving sources from antiquity and offers
                    insights into the warfare, religion, customs, and attitudes of the ancient Greeks.</div>
                <div id="t-elem13" class="celem">The Trojan War started because the Trojan prince Paris abducted Helen, wife of Menelaos, the king of Sparta. Menelaus persuaded his brother Agamemnon to form an alliance of Greek cities to sail to Troy and retrieve Helen.</div>

                <div id="t-elem15" class="celem">The Hundred Years' War</div>
                <div id="t-elem16" class="celem">The Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) was an intermittent conflict between England and France lasting 116 years. It began principally because King Edward III (r. 1327-1377) and Philip VI (r. 1328-1350) escalated a dispute over feudal rights
                    in Gascony to a battle for the French Crown. The French eventually won and gained control of all of France except Calais.</div>
                <div id="t-elem17" class="celem">The Hundred Years' War had many consequences, both immediate and long-lasting. First, there was the death of those in battle and those civilians killed or robbed by marauding soldiers between battles. English had won some great victories,
                    the final result was the loss of all territory in France except Calais. Trade was negatively affected, and the peasantry had to endure endless rounds of taxation to pay for the war, resulting in several rebellions such as the Peasants'
                    Revolt of 1381.</div>
                <div id="t-elem18" class="celem">Military technology developed over the period, in particular, the use of more efficient gunpowder weapons and the strengthening and adaptation of castles and fortified towns to meet this threat. In addition, by the war's end, Charles VII
                    had created France's first permanent royal army.</div>
                <div id="t-elem19" class="celem">World War I</div>
                <div id="t-elem20" class="celem"></div>
                <div id="t-elem21" class="celem">World War I, also called the First World War, began on July 28, 1914 and lasted until November 11, 1918. It was a global war and lasted exactly 4 years, 3 months and 2 weeks. Most of the fighting was in Europe, but soldiers from many other
                    countries took part, and it changed the colonial empires of the European powers. There were 135 countries that took part in World War I, and nearly 10 million people died while fighting. Before the war, European countries had formed
                    alliances to protect themselves. However, that made them divide themselves into two groups: the Allied Powers (mainly Russia, France and the British Empire) and the Central Powers (mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire).</div>
                <div id="t-elem22" class="celem">World War I was the first major war in which tanks, airplanes and submarines were important weapons.</div>
                <div id="t-elem23" class="celem">The war was ended by the signing of many different treaties which were meant to prevent wars. People were shocked by the size of the war, how many people it killed and how much damage it caused. They hoped it would be the war "to end all
                    wars". Instead, it led to another, larger world war 21 years later.</div>
                <div id="t-elem24" class="celem">World War II</div>
                <div id="t-elem25" class="celem">World War II was the biggest and deadliest war in history, involving more than 30 countries. Sparked by the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland, the war dragged on for six bloody years until the Allies defeated Nazi Germany and Japan in 1945.
                    There is no exact total number of deaths because many of them were unrecorded. Many studies said that more than 60 million people died in the war, mostly civilians. Mostly, people died because they were sick, hungry to death, bombed,
                    or the wrong ethnicity.</div>
                <div id="t-elem26" class="celem">After World War II, Germany was left in ruins. The victorious Allies that occupied it split it into four parts. The eastern half was occupied by the USSR. The city of Berlin was also split among the four countries even though it was entirely
                    within the eastern half. From April 1948 to May 1949, the Soviets blockaded West Berlin to prevent the city from using West Germany's currency. In 1961, the East German government built the Berlin Wall, dividing the two halves of the
                    city, and heavily guarded it to prevent more people from escaping to the west. The wall was considered a symbol of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain that divided Europe.
